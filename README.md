# Marketing-Tool
The project is designed as a way for me to refine my python programming skills while also creating a tool that is useful to me. I'm not a Marketing major or anything
however, I intend to leave this project open to the public to allow everyone to use it for their Marketing classes. This project will not cover all marketing topics
as I won't be taking all those classes, however it covers basic things that one may encounter if required to take Marketing classes.
